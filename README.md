# Normalizing-Flows
This repository offers an implementation of some of the most common architectures for normalizing flows. If you are here you may be interested by this nice repository https://github.com/bayesiains/nflows which contains many flow components implementation as well!

---
## Dependencies

- torch (> 1.5)
- numpy
- umnn (pip install umnn)

---

Still in progress, you can check the models folder for basic implementation of affine and monotonic transformations 
and coupling or autorgressive conditioners.

---
## Short tutorials:

### 2D toy problems

This one shows how to build simple autoregressive feed-forward normalizing flows.

### Flow for images

### Conditional normalizing flows

### Graphical normalizing flows
